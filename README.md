# Optimization-and-operations-research
Developing an application that allows to solve a given optimization problem.

# Applications
* Linear programming: simplex method, duality
* Dynamic programming: modeling as shortest path problems
* Optimization problems: traveling salesman, knapsack, scheduling, flow
* Integer linear programming: branch and bound methods
* Neighborhood concept, local search methods, heuristics
* Metaheuristics: genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, taboo search
